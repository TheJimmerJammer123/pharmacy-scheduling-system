# 🤖 Pharmacy AI Chatbot Developer

## Operational Ground Rules
- Frontend is Dockerized with HMR. Control via docker compose, not npm restart.
- Use Tailscale IPs for cross-device testing:
  - API: http://100.120.219.68:3001
  - Frontend: http://100.120.219.68:3000
- Volumes policy: use named volumes for state; bind mounts only for dev HMR.
- Role-specific security:
  - Do not expose SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in client code or logs.
  - Guardrail: `grep -R "SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" -n [frontend/dist](frontend/dist:1) || true`
- See: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md:1)

   - "Check message status for recent communications"

4. **Multi-Source Combinations**: Complex queries requiring multiple data sources
   - "Show me employees with low SMS response rates and their recent schedules"
   - "Analyze correlation between schedule changes and employee messages"

## AI Implementation Architecture

### Backend AI Handler (example)
```typescript
import express from 'express'

interface ChatRequest { message: string; user_role: 'manager' | 'employee'; context?: any[]; employee_id?: string }

interface QueryStrategy {
  type: 'sql' | 'rest' | 'sms' | 'multi'
  queries: string[]
  reasoning: string
}

const router = express.Router()
router.post('/api/ai/chat', async (req, res) => {
  const { message, user_role, context, employee_id } = req.body as ChatRequest
  const strategy = await determineQueryStrategy(message, user_role)
  const data = await executeQueries(strategy)
  const aiResponse = await generateAIResponse(message, data, user_role, context)
  res.json({ response: aiResponse, strategy: strategy.type, data_sources: strategy.queries.length, reasoning: strategy.reasoning })
})

async function determineQueryStrategy(message: string, userRole: string): Promise<QueryStrategy> {
  // Analyze message intent and complexity
  const keywords = {
    analytics: ['analyze', 'average', 'total', 'compare', 'trend', 'pattern'],
    schedule: ['schedule', 'shift', 'coverage', 'availability', 'conflict'],
    employee: ['employee', 'staff', 'worker', 'person', 'contact'],
    communication: ['message', 'sms', 'text', 'communication', 'response'],
    time: ['week', 'month', 'today', 'yesterday', 'recent', 'past']
  }
  
  const messageLower = message.toLowerCase()
  
  // Determine complexity and required data sources
  if (keywords.analytics.some(k => messageLower.includes(k))) {
    return {
      type: 'sql',
      queries: ['complex_analytics_query'],
      reasoning: 'Complex analytical query requires SQL aggregations'
    }
  } else if (keywords.communication.some(k => messageLower.includes(k))) {
    return {
      type: 'multi',
      queries: ['messages_query', 'contacts_query'],
      reasoning: 'Communication query requires message and contact data'
    }
  } else {
    return {
      type: 'rest',
      queries: ['simple_api_query'],
      reasoning: 'Simple query can be handled with REST API'
    }
  }
}
```

### AI Query Examples

    EXTRACT(DOW FROM ss.schedule_date) as day_of_week,
    CASE 
      WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT ss.employee_name) < 3 THEN 'understaffed'
      WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT ss.employee_name) > 6 THEN 'overstaffed'
      ELSE 'adequate'
    END as coverage_status
  FROM stores s
  LEFT JOIN store_schedules ss ON s.id = ss.store_id
  WHERE ss.schedule_date BETWEEN $1 AND $2
  GROUP BY s.store_number, ss.schedule_date
