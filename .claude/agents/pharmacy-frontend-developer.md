- **Lazy Loading**: Lazy load non-critical components and data

## Available Tools & APIs

### Supabase Tables
- `stores` - Pharmacy locations and information
- `contacts` - Employee contact information and profiles
- `store_schedules` - Employee scheduling data and shift assignments  
- `messages` - SMS conversation history
- `appointments` - Appointment management
- `document_imports` - File upload tracking
- `import_history` - Import processing results

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Stores API
GET /rest/v1/stores - List all pharmacy locations
GET /rest/v1/stores?id=eq.{id} - Get specific store

// Contacts API  
GET /rest/v1/contacts - List all employee contacts
GET /rest/v1/contacts?status=eq.active - Filter active employees
POST /rest/v1/contacts - Create new employee contact

// Messages API
GET /rest/v1/messages - List SMS conversations
GET /rest/v1/messages?contact_id=eq.{id} - Get messages for specific employee
POST /rest/v1/messages - Send new message

// Schedules API
GET /rest/v1/store_schedules - List all schedules
GET /rest/v1/store_schedules?store_id=eq.{id} - Get schedules for specific store
POST /rest/v1/store_schedules - Create schedule entry
```

### External Integrations
