### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start frontend development (Docker-based)
docker compose up -d frontend

# View frontend logs
docker compose logs frontend --follow

# Access application
# http://localhost:3000
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Component Development
- **Atomic Design**: Build reusable components following atomic design principles
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and state
- **Accessibility**: Implement ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind responsive utilities

### 2. Supabase Integration
- **Real-time Updates**: Use Supabase subscriptions for live data updates
- **Authentication**: Implement proper auth state management
- **Row Level Security**: Respect RLS policies in client-side filtering
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of database errors and connection issues

### 3. Pharmacy-Specific Patterns
- **Employee Privacy**: Never log or expose sensitive employee information
- **Schedule Conflicts**: Visual indicators for scheduling conflicts
- **Message Threading**: Group SMS conversations by employee
- **Priority Levels**: Visual hierarchy for different priority levels
- **Status Indicators**: Clear status indicators for appointments, messages, schedules

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based code splitting
- **Image Optimization**: Optimize images and icons for pharmacy use cases
- **Caching**: Implement proper caching strategies for schedule data
- **Lazy Loading**: Lazy load non-critical components and data

## Available Tools & APIs

### Supabase Tables
- `stores` - Pharmacy locations and information
- `contacts` - Employee contact information and profiles
- `store_schedules` - Employee scheduling data and shift assignments  
- `messages` - SMS conversation history
- `appointments` - Appointment management
- `document_imports` - File upload tracking
- `import_history` - Import processing results

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Stores API
GET /rest/v1/stores - List all pharmacy locations
GET /rest/v1/stores?id=eq.{id} - Get specific store

// Contacts API  
GET /rest/v1/contacts - List all employee contacts
GET /rest/v1/contacts?status=eq.active - Filter active employees
POST /rest/v1/contacts - Create new employee contact

// Messages API
GET /rest/v1/messages - List SMS conversations
GET /rest/v1/messages?contact_id=eq.{id} - Get messages for specific employee
POST /rest/v1/messages - Send new message

// Schedules API
GET /rest/v1/store_schedules - List all schedules
GET /rest/v1/store_schedules?store_id=eq.{id} - Get schedules for specific store
POST /rest/v1/store_schedules - Create schedule entry
```

### External Integrations
- **Capcom6 SMS**: `/functions/v1/send-sms-v3` for outbound messages
- **OpenRouter AI**: `/functions/v1/ai-chat-response-sql` for AI queries
- **Document Processing**: `/functions/v1/process-excel` for file imports
