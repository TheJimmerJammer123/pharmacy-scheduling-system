open http://localhost:3001
# Username: supabase
# Password: this_password_is_insecure_and_should_be_updated
```

## Architecture & Code Organization

### Directory Structure
- `frontend/` - React application with Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- `supabase/` - **Self-hosted Supabase configuration** (volumes, configs, migrations)
- `scripts/` - Project-wide utilities and helper scripts
- `volumes/` - Legacy Docker volumes (being phased out in favor of supabase/volumes/)

### Key Frontend Architecture
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: React Query + React Context
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **API Client**: Supabase JavaScript client
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

### Database Schema (Expected vs Actual)
**Frontend expects these tables:**
- `contacts` - Employee contact information
- `messages` - SMS conversation history  
- `stores` - Pharmacy locations
- `store_schedules` - Employee scheduling data
- `appointments` - Appointment management

**Current database has:**
- `profiles` - Basic user profiles only

**Action needed:** Database migrations must be created to match frontend expectations.

## Service Ports

- **Frontend**: 3000 (Dockerized Vite dev server with hot reload)
- **Supabase Studio**: 3001 (Docker mapped, accessible from host)
- **API Gateway (Kong)**: 8002 (main external access point)
- **PostgreSQL**: 5433 (external connection via Supavisor)
- **Connection Pooler**: 6543 (transaction pooling)
- **Analytics (Logflare)**: 4000 (internal monitoring)
- **Capcom6 SMS**: 100.126.232.47:8080 (via Tailscale)

## External Integrations

### Capcom6 SMS Gateway
- **Mode**: Local server via Tailscale network
- **Authentication**: Basic auth (username: sms, password: ciSEJNmy)
- **Webhook endpoint**: `/functions/v1/capcom6-webhook`

## Project Organization Guidelines

### Code Organization Rules

1. **Service Isolation**: Each service must have its own directory with all related files
2. **Docker-First**: All services should be containerized and defined in the unified `docker-compose.yml`
3. **Best Practices**: 
   - Write concise, readable code
   - Follow language-specific conventions
   - Include proper error handling
   - Add comprehensive documentation
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
4. **Configuration Management**: Keep configuration files in dedicated `config/` subdirectories
5. **Testing**: Include tests for all services in their respective `tests/` directories

### File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for directories and files
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Include version numbers in configuration files when appropriate
- Use `.md` extension for all documentation files

### Git Workflow

- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Include service prefix in commit messages (e.g., `[frontend]`, `[supabase]`)
- Update `CLAUDE.local.md` with important context and decisions

## Development Workflow

1. **Service Development**: Always work within the appropriate service directory
2. **Docker Integration**: Test services using the unified docker-compose setup
3. **MCP Integration**: Use the appropriate MCP server for service-specific tasks
   - **Context7 MCP**: For general code analysis and documentation
   - **Playwright MCP**: For frontend testing and debugging
   - **Supabase MCP**: For backend database and API operations
4. **Testing**: Run tests before committing changes
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation when making changes
6. **Backend First**: Ensure database schema matches frontend TypeScript types
7. **API-First**: PostgREST provides auto-generated REST API from database schema
8. **Real-time**: Use Supabase Realtime for live updates

## Testing Strategy

- **Frontend**: Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests
- **Integration**: Playwright for end-to-end testing  
- **Database**: Test against actual PostgreSQL instance
- **API**: Test PostgREST endpoints directly

## Important Development Notes

### Schema Mismatch Issue
The frontend TypeScript definitions in `src/lib/supabase.ts` define a complete pharmacy database schema, but the actual database only contains basic Supabase tables. Priority should be given to implementing the missing database schema.

### Backend Directory Structure
The `supabase/` directory contains the actual project backend configuration including Docker Compose setup, database volumes, and Supabase-specific files. This is the working backend for the pharmacy project.

### Environment Configuration
- Use a single unified `.env` file in the project root directory
- Keep sensitive data in `.env` files (not committed to git)
- Document all required environment variables in `CLAUDE.local.md`
- Reference the [official Supabase self-hosting documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) for environment variable setup

### Performance and Security
- Follow security best practices for each technology stack
- Optimize Docker images for size and performance
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use health checks for all services
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Supabase Self-Hosting Reference

For Supabase setup issues, refer to the [official Supabase self-hosting documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker).

**Key Supabase Setup Steps:**
1. Use `docker compose up -d` to start services
2. Check service health with `docker compose ps`
3. Access Supabase Studio at `http://localhost:3001`
4. Default credentials: `supabase` / `this_password_is_insecure_and_should_be_updated`
5. API endpoints available at `http://localhost:8002`
6. Database accessible via Supavisor pooler on port 5433
