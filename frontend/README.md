# Frontend Documentation Pointer

The project uses a single root README and AI-first docs. See:
- [README.md](README.md:1) for overall instructions
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md:1) for agent guardrails and working commands

Note: Frontend runs Dockerized with HMR; control via docker compose (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md:1)).
